# Password Generator
This web application generates a password from various user inputs.

## How it works
User must click on 'Generate Password' to start the process of generating a password. A prompt asks for an input between 8 and 128 characters in length. This will be the length of the new password. If the user wishes to cancel the process, they can click cancel in the prompt to end the password generation.

After a user inputs a length, they are asked to choose from a selection of different types of characters (Special, numeric, uppercase, lowercase). The user must select at least one of these special characters. If the user does not select any of these, the alert will ask them to re-select their choices, otherwise the user can cancel out of the process.

The user will see their new password in the text area on the webpage. The 'Copy to Clipboard' button will turn from grey to blue in colour, to indicate that the button can be clicked and the password can be copied.
